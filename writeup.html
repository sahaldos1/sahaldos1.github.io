<br/><br/><br/><center><p1> The word cloud for this assignment depended on my previous work from Assignment 3. For assignment 3 I created a java program <br/>
which read in song lyrics and printed out a word frequency list for the words used in the song. I used a hashmap for this project. The reason for <br/>
this is because it made the most obvious sense in a situation where we were dealing with words and then a counter for how many times those words <br/>
appeared. The benefit of the hashmap structure is that it allows me to count in words as keys and assign the value for each element as the number <br/>
of times it appears in the song. This makes the issue of counting word frequency very simple. My application read in from the input file word by word <br/>
and as each word was read in, it was added into the hashmap data structure. The key for each entry was set as the word itself, with the value initially <br/>
being set to 1. For every new word read in, this process is repeated. If there is a word read in that is already in the hashmap, it's value is set to one <br/>
greater than it originally was. After this process was complete, a function to sort the hashmap by value was ran. Then a print stream was used to to print <br/>
the content of the hashmap into the output file. This generated the word frequency list for “In the End”.<br/>
<br/> I chose a word cloud to visualize my data because it was simple and easy to understand. I believe it is best to be simple when presenting data so you <br/>
avoid miscommunication. A word cloud was the perfect data visualization technique because it clearly indicated which words appeared more frequently than others. <br/>
<br/> If I had more time to work on this project I would have attempted to include more songs frequency lists. I think it would have been interesting to put other<br/> 
Linkin Park Songs through the app to generate word frequency lists and compare which words are most frequent in which songs. This could have enabled viewers to <br/>
get a better feel for what the song is supposed to convey. <br/>
<br/> Finally (In the end haha), I chose this song mostly for sentimental reasons. Linkin Park was the first band I really got into as a kid in elementary/middle <br/>
school. In the End was the first song I really listened to of theirs and my love of their music went on from there.  In the End isn’t only just one of my old <br/>
favorites, it’s also probably Linkin Park’s most recognizable song.  This song enjoyed huge success when they released Hybrd Theory back in 2000 and it peaked at <br/>
number 2 on Billboard’s top 100 in March 2002. It’s considered among the best rock songs of the decade and I’m pretty sure almost everyone has heard it in passing.<br/>
The top words weren’t really a surprise. They were mostly the words associated with the chorus such as “In the end, it doesn’t even matter”. <br/>
