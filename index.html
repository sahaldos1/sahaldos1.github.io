<br/><br/><center><p1> Hello! This website is presenting a word cloud created
from the results of an assignment for my Data Strucures class in Brooklyn College.
<br/> This particular word cloud reflects the lyrics of the song "In the End" by
<br/> Linkin Park. The darker the word, the more frequently it appears in the song!
<br/><br/></p1></center>

<center><ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>This word cloud was created by:</li>
  <li>-A java program I made called "Word Count"</li>
  <li>-Word Count read in song lyrics from an input file and printed a word frequency list into an output file</li>
  <li>-This cloud was the result of that list</li>
</ul></center>

<center><p1> <br /><br /> The song I used for this list is "In the End" from Linkin Park.
<br/> The lyrics are:

<div class="boxed">
It starts with one thing<br/>
I don't know why<br/>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br/>
Keep that in mind<br/>
I designed this rhyme<br/>
To explain in due time<br/>
All I know<br/>
Time is a valuable thing<br/>
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings<br/>
Watch it count down to the end of the day<br/>
The clock ticks life away<br/>
It's so unreal<br/>
Didn't look out below<br/>
Watch the time go right out the window<br/>
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know<br/>
Wasted it all just to watch you go<br/>
I kept everything inside<br/>
And even though I tried, it all fell apart<br/>
What it meant to me<br/>
Will eventually be a memory of a time when<br/>
I tried so hard<br/>
And got so far<br/>
But in the end<br/>
It doesn't even matter<br/>
I had to fall<br/>
To lose it all<br/>
But in the end<br/>
It doesn't even matter<br/>
One thing, I don't know why<br/>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br/>
Keep that in mind<br/>
I designed this rhyme<br/>
To remind myself of a time when<br/>
I tried so hard<br/>
In spite of the way you were mocking me<br/>
Acting like I was part of your property<br/>
Remembering all the times you fought with me<br/>
I'm surprised it got so<br/>
Things aren't the way they were before<br/>
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore<br/>
Not that you knew me back then<br/>
But it all comes back to me in the end<br/>
You kept everything inside<br/>
And even though I tried, it all fell apart<br/>
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when<br/>
I tried so hard<br/>
And got so far<br/>
But in the end<br/>
It doesn't even matter<br/>
I had to fall<br/>
To lose it all<br/>
But in the end<br/>
It doesn't even matter<br/>
I've put my trust in you<br/>
Pushed as far as I can go<br/>
For all this<br/>
There's only one thing you should know<br/>
I've put my trust in you<br/>
Pushed as far as I can go<br/>
For all this<br/>
There's only one thing you should know<br/>
I tried so hard<br/>
And got so far<br/>
But in the end<br/>
It doesn't even matter<br/>
I had to fall<br/>
To lose it all<br/>
But in the end<br/>
It doesn't even matter
